# dpkg-impurifier

Emit native `.deb` packages whose applications live in a Nix store closure.
`dpkg` owns install intent, configuration files, users, directories and service
units. One transaction trigger reconciles the installed descriptors into
`/opt/nix/profile`. Repository: [nix-impurifiers/dpkg-impurifier](https://github.com/nix-impurifiers/dpkg-impurifier).

This impurifier targets **dpkg**, not a particular distribution. Debian and
Ubuntu can use the same artifacts when their runtime dependencies are met.
The package-manager family is `dpkg-impurifier`, `rpm-impurifier`,
`pacman-impurifier`, and `apk-impurifier`; this repository implements dpkg.

## Build

```sh
nix build '.#runtime-deb' '.#hello-net-deb' '.#hello-offline-deb'
nix flake check -L
```

The runtime package requires Python 3 and Nix. It does not install Nix itself.
Providing Nix through an impure package is **deferred, not out of scope**:
it requires a separate installer/bootstrap implementation and tests.

## Package a Nix application

The backend uses the pinned [shared impurifier core](https://github.com/nix-impurifiers/impurifier)
for its engine, payloads and closure caches. It retains its existing descriptor,
state and cache paths. The library takes the consumer's package set rather than
choosing one for them:

```nix
let
  impurifier = inputs.dpkg-impurifier.lib.dpkg-impurifier { inherit pkgs; };
  packages = impurifier.makePackage {
    pkg = pkgs.hello;
    # Optional overrides: name, version, priority (lower wins).
  };
in {
  hello-net = packages.net;
  hello-offline = packages.offline;
  runtime = impurifier.makeRuntimeDeb {
    nixDependency = "nix-bin | nix-external-runtime";
  };
}
```

`makeDeb`, `makeNetDeb`, and `makeOfflineDeb` also return individual artifacts.
`makeRuntimeDeb.nixDependency` is a native dependency expression. A consumer
can instead name their own Nix provider, including a future impurified Nix.
The runtime searches native executable directories and
`/nix/var/nix/profiles/default/bin`. No distribution detection or implicit Nix
installer runs in maintainer scripts. An externally managed Nix installation
must have a native provider/shim package that accurately declares its presence.

Install the runtime and either application flavor with `apt install ./…deb`.
Both flavors provide the logical application name and replace/conflict with
one another. Native packages can depend on a version of that virtual name.

**Net** packages carry descriptors and host integration, without retaining the
application closure as a Nix dependency. Configure trusted substituters and
signing keys in Nix before installing them. **Offline** packages carry an
entire closure as a local binary cache; their imports use only that cache,
without remote builders. Nix and Python must already be available in either
case. The native package/repository authenticates the offline payload; its
NAR hashes still verify the imported bytes. Nothing changes global cache trust.

## Host integration

```nix
impurifier.makeOfflineDeb {
  pkg = telemetryAgent;
  users.telemetry = {
    group = "telemetry";
    description = "Telemetry daemon";
    home = "/var/lib/telemetry";
  };
  directories."/var/lib/telemetry" = {
    owner = "telemetry:telemetry";
    mode = "0750";
  };
  configFiles."/etc/telemetry/config.yaml" = {
    source = ./config.yaml;
    mode = "0640";
  };
  systemd = {
    unit = ./telemetry.service; # ExecStart=/opt/nix/profile/bin/telemetry
    enable = true;
    startOnInstall = true;
    restartOnUpgrade = true;
    stopOnRemove = true;
  };
}
```

`users` generate sysusers declarations; `directories` generate tmpfiles
rules. Accounts and persistent data survive removal. Configuration files are
native conffiles, with dpkg's usual edit/upgrade/purge behavior. `files` installs
additional `/usr` assets, excluding reserved manifest/cache paths. Both file
maps accept a source directly or `{ source; mode; }` (default `0644`).

Host integration defaults to native dependencies `systemd` and
`init-system-helpers`; consumers can override `hostDependencies` to match their
repositories. The profile is ready before new services start. Upgrades restart
running services when the binary or unit changes, without starting an
administrator-stopped service or re-enabling an administrator-disabled one.
Debian's systemd helpers are used when present, including `policy-rc.d`.

## Operations and recovery

```sh
sudo nix-profile-engine reconcile
sudo nix-profile-engine status
sudo nix-profile-engine prune --keep 2
```

The engine serializes operations with a lock. It validates the entire desired
manifest set, realizes and roots closures, checks collisions, builds a fresh
symlink tree, then atomically changes the active profile link. A failed fetch
or composition leaves the previous profile active. Equal-priority collisions
fail; lower numeric priorities win for leaf files. Directory/file collisions
and directory symlink cycles fail. Only `bin`, `sbin`, `lib`, `libexec`, `share`,
and `include` are projected; host `/etc` is managed by native package files.

A service activation failure is reported to dpkg. The profile may already
have advanced; activation remains pending and is retried on reconciliation. Pending start/restart
intent survives a failed restart, so installing the repaired unit can recover it.
That retry resumes the recorded intent; an intentionally stopped service with no
pending restart stays stopped.
Filesystem, native package database, and service changes are not one atomic
transaction. The engine does not claim whole-host rollback or zero downtime.

An awaited trigger failure can leave the runtime unconfigured. Supply the
missing cache/closure and run `dpkg --configure --pending`, or let apt repair
the pending transaction. To recover with local media, unpack the offline
flavor first, then configure pending packages:

```sh
sudo dpkg --unpack ./application-offline.deb
sudo dpkg --configure --pending
```

Generation metadata and GC roots live under `/var/lib/dpkg-impurifier`.
Old generations remain rooted until explicitly pruned; pruning never removes
the active generation. Nix garbage collection remains a separate action.
Use native package downgrades to roll back install intent and host files.

See [testing](docs/development/testing.md) and
[design decisions and deferred work](docs/design.md). The broader
[targets inventory](docs/targets.md) tracks other package-manager and recipe targets.

MIT.

Lifecycle hooks `lifecycle.onInstall` and `lifecycle.onUpgrade` accept shell bodies. They run as root after accounts/directories exist and the new profile is published, before service activation. Use `/opt/nix/profile/bin/<tool>` for projected commands and declare native dependencies for other commands. Install hooks run until the application's first successful activation; upgrade hooks run when its output, version or hook revision changes, including native downgrades. A failed hook leaves activation pending and may be retried, so hooks must be idempotent. They do not provide database rollback or exactly-once execution. Flavor-only changes to the same application do not rerun completed hooks.

Host-library bridging is opt-in:

```nix
hardware = {
  libraries."libdriver.so.1" = "/usr/lib/libdriver.so.1";
  programs = [ "my-tool" ];
  preload = []; # Optional subset of declared library names.
};
```

The engine captures explicitly selected ELF files into an immutable Nix-store directory, roots it with the generation, and wraps the selected application's `bin` commands with `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` and optional `LD_PRELOAD`. Native library-directory transaction hooks reconcile driver upgrades. Changed snapshots create a new generation and restart previously running managed services according to their upgrade policy. Older generations retain their original user-space snapshot. Missing or unreadable libraries abort before profile publication; the existing snapshot remains usable.

Consumers select compatible libraries, their non-Nix dependencies, paths and native package dependencies. This does not discover a GPU stack, validate its ABI, rebind already-running processes, or roll back kernel modules. GPU user/kernel compatibility and real-device behavior need hardware tests. Sources outside `/usr/lib`, `/usr/lib64`, `/lib` and `/lib64` need explicit reconciliation after updates. This is a bounded runtime bridge, not automatic GPU compatibility.

The exported `runtimeVersion` follows the pinned core source timestamp. Application dependencies require that runtime version or newer, rather than accepting every engine as `0.1.0`. This supports ordinary native engine upgrades without project release tags. Consumer-provided Nix dependency expressions remain independent of the engine's own native version.

The native frontend matrix covers Debian APT/apt-get, Aptitude, Nala, GDebi and
Synaptic. A producer VM installs their real snapshot packages and dependencies
offline. Consumers use signed APT repository metadata, reject tampering while
retaining the trusted index, verify unchanged package payloads, launch as an
ordinary user, upgrade/preserve edited configuration, purge and verify GC.
Synaptic uses its real configuration dialog under Xvfb; the test activates Keep.
GDebi is tested as an installer, with native apt handling removal.
See [fixture provenance and boundaries](docs/development/debian-frontends.md).

Final removal of the runtime reconciles and prunes before its executable and
native Nix/Python dependencies disappear. This also covers solvers which remove
the runtime automatically with the last application. Ordinary runtime upgrades
retain the normal generation policy.
